# Face Mask Detection System

This project was originally created in 2021 during my master's studies. I have now created a GitHub repository and decided to further develop this project.

## Project Description

A Face Mask Detection system constructed using OpenCV and TensorFlow, employing Deep Learning and Computer Vision concepts for identifying face masks in static images.

## Dataset and Used Frameworks

- **Dataset:** The dataset consists of around 4k images belonging to two classes: with mask and without mask. Real images of faces wearing masks were collected from Kaggle competitions and RMFD dataset [1].

- **Frameworks and Libraries Used:**
  - Matplotlib
  - Numpy
  - OpenCV
  - Scikit-learn
  - TensorFlow (with Keras and MobileNetV2)
