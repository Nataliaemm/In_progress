# Face Mask Detection System

This project was originally created in 2021 during my master's studies. I have now created a GitHub repository and decided to further develop this project.

## Project Description

Face Mask Detection system built with OpenCV and TensorFlow using Deep Learning and Computer Vision concepts to detect face masks in static images. The goal is to create an accurate and computationally efficient model that can be used in real-time applications.

## Dataset and Used Frameworks

- **Dataset:** The dataset consists of around 4k images belonging to two classes: with mask and without mask. Real images of faces wearing masks were collected from Kaggle competitions and RMFD dataset [1].

- **Frameworks Used:**
  - Numpy
  - Matplotlib
  - Scikit-learn
  - TensorFlow
  - OpenCV
